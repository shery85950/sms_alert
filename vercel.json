This tells Vercel:
- No build needed (it's static HTML/CSS/JS)
- Serve files from the root directory
- Route `/api/*` requests to your API folder

## If you have Python backend in `/api` or `/backend`:

You'll need to set up serverless functions. Create this structure:
```
/api
  └── index.py  (or your main API file)
